# WebEx information for regular calls

We use MIT’s WebEx services for the calls.

**Joining the call is restricted to the official members of the Publishing Working Group.** Joining the group for representatives of W3C Members can be done via the [join form](#) (this form must be filled by the AC representative of the Member organization).

WebEx call can be joined by:

* Dialing in to the US number: +1-617-324-0000
* Using an application started up through a call-specific Web Address (see below). Your browser will then run an application that can be used to:

    * contact the call using your computer’s audio and (possibly) video
    * dial out (free of charge) any number, internationally.  

    *Beware*: the system may try to install a program on your machine once (alas!, the application does not exist for Linux). Used with up-to-date browser the Web Address may also initiate a Web Application using using WebRTC (as of Spring 2017 this service is still a bit experimental, but should improve quickly.)

* There are also dedicated WebEx apps for iOS and Android

**Each participant should type `present+ <name>` in the irc channel immediately upon joining the call**
